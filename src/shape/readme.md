# Shape detection API
The first step torwards a new set of "Web capabilities of perception".

Javascript interfaces that expose **native implementations** of shapes detection/recognition. On this firs phase recognition will be limited to:

* **Faces**
* **Text**
* **Barcodes**

For each of this there is a specific (experimental) Detector API.
